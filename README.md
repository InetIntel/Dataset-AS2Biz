# AS2Biz Dataset

AS2Biz is an Autonomous System (AS) business classification dataset. It classifies ASes by the business sectors of their operating organizations using web presence, primarily through the organization’s official website and sibling-AS-based augmentation, while supplementing missing cases with fallback methods such as Wikipedia-based classification and AI-based organization classification derived directly from web search.

## Quick start

- Latest snapshot: see the `data/` directory for snapshot JSON files.
- File naming: `as2biz.YYYY-MM.json`

## Overview

For each snapshot month, the dataset stores:
- metadata about the snapshot and models used
- a mapping from ASN to one or more business-type labels
- the provenance of each assigned label

The JSON structure is:

```json
{
  "metadata": {
    "snapshot_month": "{yyyy_mm}",
    "web_classification_llm": "{model1}",
    "web_search_llm": "{model2}"
  },
  "data": {
    "AS1": {
      "{business type 1}": "{source}",
      "{business type 2}": "{source}"
    },
    "AS2": {
      "{business type 3}": "{source}"
    }
  }
}
```

## Field description

### `metadata`

- `snapshot_month`: snapshot month in `YYYY-MM` format, for example `2025-09`
- `web_classification_llm`: the main LLM used to classify scraped website content into business categories
- `web_search_llm`: the search-oriented LLM used for website discovery and fallback classification

Example:

```json
{
  "metadata": {
    "snapshot_month": "2025-09",
    "web_classification_llm": "gpt-4o",
    "web_search_llm": "Perplexity AI sonar-pro"
  }
}
```

### `data`

`data` is a dictionary keyed by ASN string. Each ASN maps to a dictionary whose keys are business-type labels and whose values record the source of that label.

Example:

```json
{
  "data": {
    "12345": {
      "Computer and Information Technology - Internet Service Provider (ISP)": "Direct - Website",
      "Computer and Information Technology - Phone Provider": "Inherit from AS67890"
    }
  }
}
```

## Source values

Each business label includes its provenance. Source values are:

- `Direct - Website`  
  Assigned directly from the organization’s official website after scraping and LLM classification.

- `Inherit from ...`  
  Indicates that the business type is inherited from sibling ASes belonging to the same organization. Only sibling labels with source `Direct - Website` are considered for inheritance, and only when this ASN does not already have the same business type assigned directly. For example, if an ASN already has the label ISP from its own website classification, then the same ISP label from sibling AS12345 is not added as `Inherit from AS12345`.

- `Direct - Wikipedia`  
  Assigned from Wikipedia scraping and classification in the fallback stage.

- `Direct - Fallback Web Search AI`  
  Assigned from AI-based web search and classification in the fallback stage.

## Taxonomy

AS2Biz uses a multi-label business taxonomy derived from ASdb's NAICSlite taxonomy. We keep most of ASdb's NAICSlite taxonomy, but the **Agriculture, Mining, and Refineries** sector is expanded into finer subcategories because the original taxonomy is too coarse there.
